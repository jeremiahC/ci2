					<strong>1. Introduction</strong>
					<br><br>
					This privacy policy sets out how OnTutor uses and protects any information that you give
					OnTutor when you use our website.
					<br><br>
					OnTutor is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. Should we ask you to provide
					certain information by which you can be identified when using our website, then you can be
					assured that it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.
					<br><br>
					By accepting the Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use in registration, you expressly consent to
					our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this
					Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective upon acceptance for new users and is
					otherwise effective on September 1, 2011.
					<br><br>
					<strong>2. The Information We Receive</strong>
					<br><br>
					We may collect and store the following information:
					<br>(1) Registration You can browse our sites without telling us who you are or revealing any
					personal information about yourself. However in order to purchase or teach courses or classes
					and post content on a OnTutor site, you must register and provide personal information such
					as name, email address, password, gender, birthday, nationality, time zone, etc.
					<br><br>
					(2) Tutor Profile Information To apply to become a tutor on the site, you will be required to
					provide us with more detailed personal background.
					<br><br>
					(3) Purchase/Sale Transaction To purchase any courses or classes on the site, you must
					provide us financial information such as credit/debit card information, bank account numbers,
					etc.
					<br><br>
					Usage History, Interactive Features and Public Forums We may also collect additional
					personal information when you use some features on the site and when you correspond with
					our customer service representatives by phone or email. If you use the interactive features or
					public forums (such as messages) on the site, you should be aware that any personally
					identifiable information you submit in the body of your messages can be read, collected, or
					used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.
					We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in
					these forums. We reserve the right to terminate the accounts of any registered users who use
					the OnTutor messaging system in a manner inconsistent with the Terms of Use.
					<br><br>
					<strong>3. The Information Collected Through Technology</strong>
					<br><br>
					Our site collects information through a variety of technical methods to create a “profile” of
					your preferences and for various purposes related to our business. We collect information
					through interaction with our site, services, content and advertising, including computer and
					connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the sites, ad data,
					IP address and standard web log information. We tie your personally identifiable information and your
					purchasing history to information in your profile, in order to provide tailored promotions and
					marketing offers and to improve the content of the site for you.
					<br><br>
					The following methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf:
					<br>(1) Cookies We use "cookies" (small files placed on your hard drive) on certain of our pages to help analyze our web page flow; customize our services, content and advertising; identify you and maintain your signed-in status; measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety in the usage of the site. A few important things you should know about cookies are that:
					<br>- We offer certain features that are available only through the use of cookies.
					<br>- We use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status.
					<br>- Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.
					<br>- You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of some of our sites or services.
					<br>- You may encounter cookies from third parties on certain pages of the sites that we do not control. (For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a cookie placed by that web page.)
					<br>(2) Log Files. As is true of most websites, we automatically gather certain information (such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data) and store it in log files. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may also link this data to personally identifiable information.
					<br><br>
					<strong>4. Information Relating to Children</strong>
					<br><br>
					Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Children under age 13 can only use our services under the supervision of their parents/legal guardians. If you are under age 13, please do not attempt to register for OnTutor or provide any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 13, please contact us through OnTutor Customer Support.
					<br><br>
					<strong>5. How We Use Information</strong>
					<br><br>
					We use the information you provide about yourself to understand your needs and provide you with a better service. You agree that we may use your personal information to:
					<br>(1) provide the services and customer support you request.
					<br>(2) resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems.
					<br>(3) prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our Terms of Use.
					<br>(4) customize, measure, and improve our services and the site’s content and advertising.
					<br>(5) tell you about our services, targeted marketing of products, service updates, special deals, and promotional offers as well as confirm the opening of any HTML-based emails to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and effectiveness of marketing campaigns based on the elections in your account settings.
					<br>(6) compare information for accuracy, and verify it with third parties.
					<br>(7) charge and collect bills, issue credits and debits, and disburse payments in connection with the transactions and.
					<br>(8) store all communications sent through the site.
					<br><br>
					We will also communicate with you by email in response to your inquiries, to provide any assistance you request, to manage your account (such as billing and refund issues), and to send you strictly administrative, transaction or operation-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so (such as if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance or updates to the policies). Generally, you may not opt out of these non-promotional communications. But if you do not wish to receive these administrative, transaction or operation-related communications, you have the option to deactivate your account by contacting our Customer Support.
					<br><br>
					<strong>6. Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong>
					<br><br>
					Personal information about our user is an important part of our business. We do not share your personal information with outside parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent.
					<br><br>
					OnTutor offers a “Student profile” and “Tutor profile” feature which allow users to publish portions of their profile to the public internet. Users may opt-out of this feature. However OnTutor does not warrant how third-party search engines will update their cache.
					<br><br>
					OnTutor only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of OnTutor in the following limited circumstances:
					<br>(1) Corporate Agents and Third Party Providers We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf with respect to our business operations. Examples include fraud investigations, providing customer service, processing credit card payments, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from user lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and providing search results and links (including paid listings and links). Except as separately permitted by other provisions in this Privacy Policy, these companies are allowed to gather, receive, and use your personal information only as needed to perform their functions or as required by law.
					<br>(2) Authorized Third Parties In certain circumstances, your dealings with a third party may have authorized that third party to obtain your personal information from OnTutor and to use that information in accordance with the third party’s own privacy practices and policies. We will provide your information to such third parties only to the extent you explicitly authorized us to do so.
					<br>(3) Business Transitions In the event OnTutor goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred as part of such transaction. If we purchase a business, the personally identifiable information received with that business will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy if it is practicable and permissible to do so. If we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personal information in the same manner required by the Privacy Policy effective at the time of closing. You will be notified via a prominent notice on our site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.
					<br>(4) Legal Disclaimer In an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the site free from bad actors, we reserve the right to release your account and other personal information when we believe such release is appropriate to: (a) comply with the law (including to meet our tax reporting obligations), or to respond to legal requirements (subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure served on OnTutor); (b) enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other policies; and (c) protect the rights, property, or safety of OnTutor, our users, or others when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity (including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection). In such events, we will disclose information relevant to the investigation, such as name, city, telephone number, email address, User ID history, IP address, fraud complaints, transactional history, etc (if applicable). This does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from users for commercial purposes.
					<br><br>
					<strong>7. Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</strong>
					<br><br>
					We reserve the right to share aggregated demographic information about our user base (without linking to personally identifiable information about individual users) or de-personalized individual information (removal of name and other personally identifying characteristics) with our corporate affiliates and corporate partners. Given the nature of this information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy upon the right of OnTutor to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information.
					<br><br>
					<strong>8. No Spam, Spyware or Spoofing</strong>
					<br><br>
					We and our users do not tolerate spam. Make sure to set your communication preferences so we communicate to you as you prefer. You are not allowed to add other OnTutor users, even a user who has purchased a course or class from you, to your mailing list (email or physical mail) without their express consent. To report OnTutor-related spam or spoof emails to OnTutor, please forward the email to help@ontutor.net.
					<br><br>
					You may not use our communication tools to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our Terms of Use. We automatically scan and may manually filter messages to check for spam, viruses, phishing attacks and other malicious activity or illegal or prohibited content.
					<br><br>
					<strong>9. Security</strong>
					<br><br>
					To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
					<br><br>
					The security of your personal information is extremely important to us. Your information is stored on our servers. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the site. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.
					<br><br>
					<strong>10. Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information</strong>
					<br><br>
					You can see, review and change most of your personal information by signing on to OnTutor. Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate.
					<br><br>
					<strong>11. Deactivating Your OnTutor Account</strong>
					<br><br>
					You may deactivate your account by contacting Customer Support. Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your personal information and posted course (if applicable) from the site as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.
					<br><br>
					<strong>12. Links to Other Sites and Third Party Advertisers</strong>
					<br><br>
					Our site may include third-party advertising and links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by OnTutor.
					<br><br>
					To the extent these third parties are not our corporate partners, we do not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party websites or to advertisers and Internet advertising companies working on their behalf (also called “ad networks” or “network advertisers”). These network advertisers sometimes use technology to send (or “serve”) their advertisements that appear on our site directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons, and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content.
					<br><br>
					When you click on an advertisement on our site that links to a third party website or a network advertiser, then you are leaving our site. This Privacy Policy will not apply to your personally identifiable information collected on that third party’s website. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties or network advertisers and you must read the privacy policy posted on their respective websites to see how your personally identifiable information will be handled.
					<br><br>
					<strong>13. Changes in this Privacy Policy</strong>
					<br><br>
					OnTutor may revise, modify or update this policy. We may notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your particular OnTutor account or by placing a prominent notice on our site. You are encouraged to check this policy frequently for any changes as your continued use of the OnTutor service indicates your consent to such changes.
					<br><br>
					<strong>14. Contact Information</strong>
					<br><br>
					Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please feel free to contact Customer Support through our website.
