These Tutor Terms of Use will apply to any account that is approved to be a tutor on the site.

				If you wish to provide tutoring services through OnTutor, you must complete the tutor application process. You agree to provide true, accurate, complete information and to update such information to maintain its truthfulness, accuracy and completeness. From time to time, your account may be subject to verification as well as editorial and feedback reviews. OnTutor can suspend or terminate your account upon the discovery that any information you provided or posted is not complete or accurate, or as a result of other violations of the Terms of Use.
				<br><br>
				To preserve the quality of the courses on the site and to ensure the safety of all our users, every user who wishes to teach or provide a course will be required to go through an application process.
				<br><br>
				You must complete the following simple steps before you can begin to teach:
				<br>(1) Application. Fill out an Tutor Application Form to provide us with information regarding your background, education, work experience, and other qualifications with respect to your planned courses.

We will endeavor to accept or decline your application within 2-3 business days after completing the Tutor Application Form.
				<br>(2) Becoming a Tutor. If we approve your application after our review, you will be considered a "Tutor" and your tutor profile will be listed.
				<br>(3) Courses and Rates. It is up to you to accurately describe your course(s) or class(es) for sale. For service courses that are priced at an hourly rate, you guarantee that the hourly rate offered on OnTutor is no greater than the lowest publicly available rate for your services on any other website (including, without limitation, your own website).
				<br><br>
				We reserve the right to withdraw our approval of your application and to suspend or terminate your right to teach on the Site at any time and at our sole discretion. If applicable law requires us to provide a notice of termination or cancellation, we may give notice by sending written communication to any address (email or otherwise) that we have for you in our records. You will be liable for any breaches and/or obligations incurred before we suspend or terminate your Account.
				<br><br>
				<strong>2. Guidelines for Creating a Course</strong>
				<br><br>
				You agree to utilize the following course creation guidelines:
				<br>(1) Write a specific, detailed course outline with clear scope, deliverables and lessons.
				<br>(2) Set expectations that you can meet or exceed.
				<br><br>
				When submitting your course you agree to:
				<br>(1) Not submit courses or lessons that are made with the intent to commit fraud. Doing so will result in immediate termination of your membership.
				<br>(2) Not offer your services in exchange for good review or for free.
				<br>(3) Respond promptly, within one business day, to private messages from the student.
				<br>(4) Respond promptly, within one business day, to any inquiry from Customer Support.
				<br><br>
				Violation of these guidelines may result in suspension or termination of your account. If you are aware of a potential violation, please contact Customer Support.
				<br><br>
				<strong>3. Guidelines for Providing your Tutoring Services</strong>
				<br><br>
				You agree to utilize the following service provider guidelines:
				<br>(1) If you are unable to complete a course, alert Customer Support so that OnTutor is aware of the situation and can offer assistance to the student.
				<br>(2) Respond promptly, within 1 business day, to all course-related communication, whether from the student or from OnTutor.
				<br>(3) Report any tutor rating system violation by contacting Customer Support.
				<br>(4) After the course is completed, send a report to the student.
				<br><br>
				Violation of these guidelines may result in suspension or termination of your Account. If you are aware of a potential violation, please contact Customer Service.
				<br><br>
				<strong>4. Tutor-Student Communication; Solicitation and Disclosure of Personal Information
				</strong><br><br>
				All communications between you and your student(s) must be limited to the subject of your course or to advance learning. You acknowledge and agree that you are not permitted to discuss reviews with any student or to make any comments or suggestions to any student regarding any future or past review. Absent a pre-existing relationship with a student outside of the site, you are not allowed to communicate with any of your students by any means other than through our site.
				<br><br>
				You agree that you are prohibited from soliciting any personally identifiable information (such as birth date, age, email address, phone number or home address) from any student on OnTutor and that you are prohibited from disclosing such personally identifiable information to any third party. You are not allowed to obtain any personal information from your student other than their name.
				<br><br>
				<strong>5. Payment Terms for Tutor</strong>
				<br><br>
				(1) You need to make sure that the PayPal account email address provided by you is correct; OnTutor does not assume any responsibility in case the payment is made to a wrong PayPal account email address.
				<br>(2) Your Bank Account. If you are a tutor located in Korea, you need to provide us with a valid bank account based in Korea. Your transaction must be payable in Korean Won.
				<br>(3) How to receive payment for services. You need to submit a student report after you complete delivery of each purchased course to get paid for the course. The amount will be added on your Account page in the My OnTutor menu 7 days after you submit a report. You can request a withdrawal of the amount you wish to then. If you don't request a withdrawal, the remaining credits will be stored in your payment account. It can be used for your future purchases. The payment will be transferred to your registered account twice a month (on the 10th, 25th) for the amount you requested, as long as the request was made 2 business days prior to the transfer and students don’t dispute the course. However, the payment will be withdrawn on the next day if the withdrawal date is on a Sat., Sun., or a holiday (Korean calendar and time).
				<br>(4) Posting of Earned Amounts. The total amount of all payments earned through your purchased courses will post to your Account. You can check your due balance through the My Earnings page in the My OnTutor menu.
				<br>(5) Taxes. You are solely responsible for all applicable federal, state, local, and foreign taxes or charges imposed by any government entity, directly or indirectly, in connection with your enrollment as a tutor.
				<br>(6) OnTutor Commission. Joining the site, browsing for tutors and listing services is free. We charge commission fees only when your purchased course is completed, and the transaction is not cancelled. Fees due to OnTutor are deducted from your earnings. For each purchase transaction on the site, our commission is the greater of either 12, 14 or 16% (according to the tutors' status as below) of the total price of the course plus transaction fee (as below) or $3.00 per purchase transaction.
				<br>Tutor Status 	% of commission 	Per Transaction fee
				<br>Top tutor 	12% of price paid 	$0.5
				<br>Rising Star tutor 	14% of price paid 	$1.0
				<br>New tutor 	16% of price paid 	$1.5
				<br>※ Minimum commission is USD 3.
				<br>To the extent any refunds are issued under the Terms of Use, our commission fees will be based only on the amount that is not refunded back to the student.
				<br><br>
				You agree not to engage in any action or activity meant to circumvent the commissions. Prohibited practices include (but are not limited to) the following:
				<br>- Suggesting or soliciting students to hire you outside the OnTutor system.
				<br>- Reporting on the site a service price different than that agreed between student and tutor.
				<br><br>
				<strong>6. Withholding or Delaying Disbursement of Funds</strong>
				<br><br>
				If we reasonably conclude based on information available to us that your actions and/or performance in connection with the courses may result in a significant number of disputes, refunds or other claims from users who purchased your course, we reserve the right to delay initiating the disbursement of all funds accrued in your OnTutor account for the shorter of either 30 days following the initial date of suspension or completion of an investigation. If we believe that you may have violated the Terms of Use (including the Privacy Policy and these Tutor Terms of Use), we may refuse to disburse the funds accrued in your account and/or debit such funds from your account. We will not be liable to you if we act in accordance with the provisions of this section.
				<br><br>
			<strong>7. OnTutor’s Rights Regarding Funds</strong>
				<br><br>
				We may earn interest or other compensation from the balances in our bank accounts that result from the timing difference between the payment for a purchased course and the disbursement of the corresponding funds to you. You are not entitled to any such interest or other compensation.
				<br><br>
				We reserve the right to seek reimbursement from you if we, in our sole discretion,
				<br>(1) provide a refund to a student if you cannot promptly deliver the purchased course,
				<br>(2) discover erroneous or duplicate transactions, or
				<br>(3) receive a chargeback from the student’s credit card issuer for the amount of the student’s purchase from you. This means that you will be responsible for the amount of the payment (plus the applicable fees) if you lose a claim or a chargeback, or if there is a reversal of the payment. You authorize us to obtain such reimbursement by deducting from future payments owed to you, reversing any credits to your account, debiting your bank account, or seeking such reimbursement from you by any other lawful means.
				<br><br>
				<strong>8. Student Cancellations; Refunds</strong>
