				<strong>OnTutor came from the question,</strong>
			 <br><br>	"Is there any better and easier way to learn foreign languages from native speakers?".
				
				OnTutor founders, Kyungjoo Im and Todd Norman thoroughly believe that anyone can speak languages well if one keeps practicing.
			 <br><br>	However it's not easy for people who don't live in the city to go to a language school and expensive to go abroad to learn the language they want.
			 <br><br>	OnTutor was designed to allow anyone who logs on from anywhere they choose to learn languages easily.
			 <br><br>	
				OnTutor's goal is to help qualified tutors and students find each other quickly, easily and free of charge.
			 <br><br>	Using our service, a tutor can attract students with ease. Students can search for a tutor to help them master a language. It is a win-win for both the students and the tutors!
			 <br><br>	
				We have fully qualified and cost-effective tutors with teaching ability, so you decide who you want to hire and how much to pay them.
			 <br><br>	Join us now, it's all free!
